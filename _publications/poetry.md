_Abstract_-With the increasing popularity of portable devices with cameras (e.g., smartphones and tablets) and ubiquitous Internet connectivity, travelers can share their instant experience during the travel by posting photos they took to social media platforms. In this paper, we present a new image-driven poetry recommender system that takes a traveler’s photo as input and recommends classical poems that can enrich the photo with aesthetically pleasing quotes from the poems. Three critical challenges exist to solve this new problem: i) how to extract the implicit artistic conception embedded in both poems and images? ii) How to identify the salient objects in the image without knowing the creator’s intent? iii) How to accommodate the diverse user perceptions of the image and make a diversified poetry recommendation? The proposed iPoemRec system jointly addresses the above challenges by developing heterogeneous in- formation network and neural embedding techniques. Evaluation results from real-world datasets and a user study demonstrate that our system can recommend highly relevant classical poems for a given photo and receive significantly higher user ratings compared to the state-of-the-art baselines.
