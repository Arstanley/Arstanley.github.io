I have done some interesting projects in my spare time. Some of them are my personal interest and some of them are related to my research projects.

* **[MarketND:](www.marketnd.net)** When every semester ends, Lots of furnitures from students are thrown to trash. Many of them are in very good condition. Inspired by such wastes, I created this app using the **Ionic** and **React** framework for future resale of the furnitures. 

* **[Log-Normal Mixture Implementation:](https://github.com/Arstanley/LogNormal-Mixture)** For our KDD20 project, we want to model the distribution of normal users and mallicious users in _Tencent Weibo_ data. Scikit-learn only provides mixture model for gaussian distribution. For this purpose, I implemented log-normal mixture model with Expectaion-Maximization algorithm.
