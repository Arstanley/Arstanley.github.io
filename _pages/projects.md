I have done some interesting projects in my spare time. Some of them are my personal interest and some of them are related to my research projects.

* **[Propensity Score Matching for Fake News](https://github.com/Arstanley/fakenews_pscore_match)** The implementation repository for my paper _Improving Generalizability of Fake News Detection Methods using Propensity Score Matching_. For more details, please kindly refer to the README file in the repository page.

* **[Visual Poet:](https://ttl-2h-z52niiiz2a-uc.a.run.app/)** This is the poetry recommendation system that we built for the paper _Through The Eyes of A Poet: Classical Poetry Recommendation with Visual Input on Social Media_. You can upload a photo to get a poetry recommendation. For my japanese class project, I changed the Chinese classical poetry in the database to Japanese Haiku that I scraped from online sources. The app is built with **Flask** and deployed with **Google App Engine**.  

* **[Log-Normal Mixture Implementation:](https://github.com/Arstanley/LogNormal-Mixture)** For our KDD20 project, we want to model the distribution of normal users and mallicious users in _Tencent Weibo_ data. Scikit-learn only provides mixture model for gaussian distribution. For this purpose, I implemented log-normal mixture model with Expectaion-Maximization algorithm.
