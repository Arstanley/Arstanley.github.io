 Welcome! I am a senior at the University of Notre Dame studying mathematics and computing. I plan to graduate in 2021. Currently, I am working in [the Notre Dame DM2 Lab](https://www.meng-jiang.com/lab.html) with [Prof. Meng Jiang](https://www.meng-jiang.com/) on data mining and anomaly detection. In the past, I am fortunate to have worked with [Prof. Dong Wang](https://www3.nd.edu/~dwang5/) in the Social Sensing Lab. Please kindly find my attached CV [here](https://arstanley.github.io/files/spring_2020.pdf)

Research
======
 I am interested in general machine learning and social computing. Specifically, on graphs learning and causal learning. I have also worked on topics in computer vision project. 

What's New
======
* December 2020: I am selected for **honorable mention for the Computing Research Association's (CRA) Outstanding Undergraduate Researcher Award** for 2021!
* November 2020: One paper was uploaded on Arxiv: "Early Anomaly Detection by Learning and Forecasting Behavior"!
* August 2020: One paper was accepted by the Second International Workshop on Deep Learning on Graphs: Methods and Applications (DLG-KDD'20)!
