 Welcome! I am a junior at the University of Notre Dame studying mathematics and computing. I plan to graduate in 2021. Currently, I am working in [the Notre Dame DM2 Lab](http://www.meng-jiang.com/lab.html) with [Prof. Jiang](http://www.meng-jiang.com/) on data mining and anomaly detection. In the past, I am fortunate to have worked with [Prof. Dong](https://www3.nd.edu/~dwang5/) and [Prof. Do](https://scholar.harvard.edu/synho/home) from Harvard Medical School. Please kindly find my attached CV [here]("http://academicpages.github.io/files/spring_2020.pdf")
